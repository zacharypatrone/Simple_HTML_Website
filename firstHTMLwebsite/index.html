            <p id="aboutme">Hi my name is <strong>Zachary Patrone</strong> and I am a senior at San Diego State Univeristy studying Managment Information Systems. I am 23 years old with a passion for programming and technology. The world is requiring us to be at the forefront of innovation, and I hope to be a part of that someday. I am excited to be a part of a company that shares these ideas and believes we can do better.</p>
            <p id="aboutme">Outside of my school life, I enjoy camping out in the desert, playing video games with friends, classic cars, and watching sports. I grew up in Thousand Oaks, which is about 45 minutes north of Los Angeles. I love road trips and I like to be believe I have more patience than most people, probably why I enjoy coding so much. </p>

            <p id="aboutme">I believe that the best to learn is thorugh trying and failing at something over and over until you get it right. Not giving up and telling yourself you're sticking with it because you told yourself you would. I have learned more through the process of failure than simply getting on the first or second try. I love building and creating things, whether its programming, design, writing, or getting out the tools and getting my hands dirty. Even creating this website had its moments of failures and looking back on it, it was all the little things that just weren't compiling correctly. I'm proud of my first website and I am excited to see how it changes with me through the years. </p>
