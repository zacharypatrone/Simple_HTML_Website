            <h3>Business Process Redesign</h3>
            <p>In this report, my team and I analyzed the SDGE Environmental Services Department' invoice tracking system. Using key performance metrics, we found that the current process was not maximizing savings and recommended utilizing Quikbooks as a way to manage the invoices. </p>

              <h3>Game Development</h3>
              <p>During the Coronavirus pandemic, I had more time on my hands and with my passion for programming, I started to develop a game. It is still a work in progress but I hope to finish it soon. I taught myself how to use Unity and some C# to get basic character movements in a 2D platformer. I would like to make a more advanced game, but I am taking my time with this one to make sure I understand the fundamentals before I challenge myself even further.</p>

              <h3>Computer Build</h3>
              <p>After my six year old laptop fell off a table and broke the screen, I decided to make the switch to a desktop, and I've never looked back. I built this computer during the pandemic to stay connected with my friends through gaming and for running any program I may need for school. I learned a lot about the computers functions and how error codes can relate to physical hardware. I cannot wait until I can build/upgrade again in the future!</p>
