            <h3>Sports</h3>
            <p>Growing up near Los Angeles meant that I was going to be a fan of the LA sports teams. I am most invested in hockey and football. My uncle has season tickets to the LA Kings and I have been going to games since I was a kid. The team has changed a lot this season, but the new guys are looking promising! On the football side, I hope Stafford does well on the Rams and I have high hopes for the team this year!</p>

              <h3>The Outdoors</h3>
              <p>As much as I love computers and everything related to technology, it is important to take a break from the screen and go outside. A couple times a year I go camping in Joshua Tree for a couple nights and it allows me to clear my head. I've always wanted to drive through Utah and visit Moab, maybe one of these summers I'll make it out there!</p>

            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>Videos games have always been a hobby of mine that has kept so many great friendships alive. Going to college seperated my long-time friend group, but being able to hang out online meant they were never too far away. This pandemic led me to build my own computer, which keeps me connected with all my friends through quarentine. My favorites include Call of Duty, Valorant, Fortnite, and Sea of Thieves!</p>
